Renames files based on the names of other files.
Use the wizard or add files and naming reference files manually.
Optionally reorder them before applying rename.
Use the logger to trace steps back in case there's a mistake in renaming.

Note: Even though the logger will help trace back steps, it's always better to create a backup before attempting to rename files in bulk.
